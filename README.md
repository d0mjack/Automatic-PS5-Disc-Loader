# Automatic-PS5-Disc-Launcher
This will allow people who buy physical ps5 games to be able to swap them out automatically, without having to get up, all from your phone

Its made up of disc "sleeves" that hold your disks, and you put them in disk trays, that stack like a tower. Then motors, controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, move the grabber along tracks, that then pick up the sleeve, pull it to the disc slot on the PS5, and load it.
